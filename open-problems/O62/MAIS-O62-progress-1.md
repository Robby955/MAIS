## Width lower bound and the case $p=3$

Opus and Iris Shi prove the improved lower bound

$$
H_{\min}(p)\ge \frac{3p-1}{2}
$$

for every odd integer $p$, and give an exact width-4 construction establishing $H_{\min}(3)=4$.

## Status of the remaining claims

- At $p=5$, the supplied width-8 fits are numerical candidates with residuals near machine precision. They do not prove $H_{\min}(5)\le8$.
- At $p=7$, the Fourier construction gives an exact width-13 fit. The separate numerical width-13 candidate adds no upper bound.
- Searches found no width-7 fit at $p=5$ and no width-12 fit at $p=7$. These negative searches are documented and calibrated, but do not prove nonexistence.

## Computational artifacts

The [artifact directory](code/) contains a standalone verifier, a high-precision refinement tool, the search protocol, and machine-readable parameters for all 13 numerical candidates. To check every candidate from the repository root:

```bash
python3 open-problems/O62/code/verify.py open-problems/O62/code/solutions/
```

The complete research archive, including the search implementation, calibration runs, and logs, is attached to [issue #2](https://github.com/lionellevine/MAIS/issues/2).
